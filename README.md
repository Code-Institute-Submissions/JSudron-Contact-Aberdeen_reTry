## Introduction - Project Purpose

For this project I was tasked with creating a website to showcase the frontend coding skills I've learnt. 
The purpose of this project is to promote a club night, Contact, which was formerly running in Aberdeen. Jonny Kennedy runs the club night along with being a DJ.
Having gone on hiatus he is now looking to start the club night up in Aberdeen again. A venue has been secured but in order to keep the night running it
must make a certain amount of money each night. Previously only Facebook was used to advertise but now Contact is looking to utilise a website in order to provide
a larger online presence to create further advertising along with having a way for users to get in touch should they want to book further events. 
I was approached to create a stylish site which provides easy navigation to the user. The main features required by Contact were providing the users with all the 
information needed to promote their club night & also to have a contact section so bookings can be made.

### Design

#### Colours

- #ffffff White
- #000000 Rich Black
- #494949 Davys Grey
- #7c7a7a Gray Web
- #ff6d73 Fiery Rose

The website [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) was used to find an attractive colour scheme which evokes a dark & minimal style.
Fiery rose was used to add a nice contrast on buttons & hover effects against the darker elements of the site. 
White text provided the best readability possible.
The colours are clean & simple & go well with the images & font used. 

#### Fonts

- Righteous & Source Sans Pro

The fonts were found on the site [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). 
Righteous was chosen as it has a slightly futuristic yet industrial look to it which goes well with the miminal colour scheme used.
Source Sans Pro was used as it has similar curves to the Righteous fonts but works better with the smaller text.
Both were chosen as for their readability.

### Wireframes

- The wireframes display the original concepts for the site, a one page site was eventually used.
