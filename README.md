# CONTACT - ABERDEEN

Project One: User Centric Frontend Development

This is a website created to promote the Contact club night and Aberdeen DJ; Jonny Kennedy. 
The site includes information about Contact & DJ Jonny Kennedy along with details about previous events run by Contact and links to
social media sites.

## Demo
A live demo can be found [here](https://jsudron.github.io/Contact-Aberdeen/).

## UX
 
### User stories

As a club owner I expect to find out why I'd want to host a club night with Contact.
As a DJ I expect to find out why I'd want to perform at a Contact club night.

### Strategy

Aimed to keep the design minimal but still showcase the artwork I was provided by the client along with being as user-friendly as possible.

### Scope 

Contact Aberdeen has run club nights before with DJ Jonny Kennedy heading these up. However, having been out of the scene for some time we wanted
to give club owners a glimpse into what Contact club nights are all about. We also wanted to use the site as a platform for DJs to get in touch
should they want to perform at a Contact club night. Therefore providing an easy means of contact on the site was a must.

### Stucture

The site structure is fairly straightforward with a fixed navbar allowing for easy access to each section.
Also provided a footer with access to Facebook, Mixcloud & Soundcloud.

### Skeleton

Wireframes were made for 2 different navigation styles, the scrolling option was used. 
Further design changes were made through the process.

[Wireframe - Scrolling](https://github.com/JSudron/Contact-Aberdeen/blob/6fbd61f474b3f65863770269bf869aa0a0e293b5/assets/wireframes/wireframe1.jpg)
[Wireframe - Seperate Pages](https://github.com/JSudron/Contact-Aberdeen/blob/6fbd61f474b3f65863770269bf869aa0a0e293b5/assets/wireframes/wireframe2.jpg)

### Surface

Went for a dark, minimal colour scheme taken from [Coolors](https://coolors.co/000000-ffffff-494949-7c7a7a-ff5d73), a free pallete generator website.
This included black, white, greys (outer space & trolley grey) & fiery rose, which adds a nice contrast on buttons & hover effects.

## Technologies
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap (4.3.1)
4. JavaScript

## Features

The use of the scrollSpy feature in Bootstrap was implemented. A smooth scrolling effect was then added to this in CSS.
Added JavaScript code to make the navbar collapse when an anchor link is closed.
A carousel was used for the gallery as this was the most effective way show off the large number of photos on all screen sizes.

### Features Left to Implement

Eventually, I'd like to add a 'music' section which would have Soundcloud music embeded directly to the site.
Would also be useful to add in an 'upcoming events' section once new bookings are made, this would include flyers with relevant info & links to
buy tickets.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

The site is hosted on GitHub pages, deployed directly using the master branch. The deplyed site updates automatically when new commits are made and
then pushed through on GitPod. The landing page is named 'index.html' in order to deploy correctly.

### Content

All content in the 'About' section was written by myself.

### Media

The header image 'bw-audience.jpg' was taken from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) stock image library,which added the greyscale filter to on Photoshop.
The remaining photos used in this site were created and obtained from the client Jonny Kennedy.

### Acknowledgements

The majority of code was learnt through Code Institute tutorials & reading through 'HTML & CSS design and build websites' by Jon Duckett.
However, specific sections have parts of code were learnt from various sites, which was then amended by myself to obtain the look & feel 
I was after. Apart from the JavaScript code, no code was copied and pasted over. An understanding of the code was learnt before code was then typed 
up with significant changes made by myself.
