# CONTACT - ABERDEEN

Project One: User Centric Frontend Development

This is a website created to promote the Contact club night and Aberdeen DJ; Jonny Kennedy. The site includes information about Contact & DJ Jonny Kennedy along with details about previous events
run by Contact and links to social media sites.

## Demo
A live demo can be found [here] (github address)

## UX
 
### User stories

As a club owner I expect to find out why I'd want to host a club night with Contact.
As a DJ I expect to find out why I'd want to perform at a Contact club night.

### Strategy

Aimed to keep the design minimal but still showcase the artwork I was provided by the client along with being as user-friendly as possible.

### Scope 

Contact Aberdeen has run club nights before with DJ Jonny Kennedy heading these up. However, having been out of the scene for some time we wanted to give club owners a glimpse into what Contact
club nights are all about. We also wanted to use the site as a platform for DJs to get in touch should they want to perform at a Contact club night. Therefore providing an easy means of contact
on the site was a must.

### Stucture

The site structure is fairly straightforward with easy navigation between the pages. There are links to social media sites which open up in a separate tab.

### Skeleton

Put links to wireframes

### Surface

Went for a dark look with contrasting bright colours to mimic the colours associated with the club night.

## Technologies
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap (4.3.1)

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
