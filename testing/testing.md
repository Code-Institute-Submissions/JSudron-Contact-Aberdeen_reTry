## Developer Tools

### Google Chrome Dev Tools

- Used to test the responsiveness of the website.
- Used to make on the fly changes to the css to alter the design of the site.
- Debugging of the javascript as errors are easily identified in the console.

### Responsinator

- Used to view to how the site looks on a wide range of screen sizes at once.

## Validation Tools

### Validator W3

- An error was found in the form section, this was due to the invalid input tag 'phone', this was changed to 'tel'.

### Jigsaw W3

- Used to validated the CSS code.
- Within my custom CSS `-webkit` properties were identified as invalid but this was ignored.

## Manual Tests

- The live web address was tested on a variety of web browsers: Chrome/Safari/Opera/Explorer.
- Each link on the site was tested to ensure it linked to the correct place.
- The contact/booking form gives error notifications when typing in an invalid e-mail address.
- The 'required' attribute also alerts the user if a field has not been entered on the form when clicking submit.
- All fields must be filled in for the form to submit correctly.
- The scrollSpy links all work with a smooth animation.
- All links to other webpages e.g. social media links have been tested. They all open using 'target="_blank" which opens the link in a new tab on the browser.

## Peer-Code Review

- Once the website was complete it was submitted to my peers for review.
- It was suggested that the gallery was not the full width of the screen, this was amended in CSS.
- The fonts was made slightly larger on the about section to enhance readability.
